# Chef-Vault
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/chef-vault.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/chef-vault)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Nordstrom/chef-vault.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Nordstrom/chef-vault)

## DESCRIPTION:

Gem that allows you to encrypt a Chef Data Bag Item using the public keys of a list of chef nodes. This allows only those chef nodes to decrypt the encrypted values.

## INSTALLATION:

Be sure you are running the latest version Chef. Versions earlier than 0.10.0 don't support plugins:

    gem install chef

This plugin is distributed as a Ruby Gem. To install it, run:

    gem install chef-vault

Depending on your system's configuration, you may need to run this command with root privileges.

## KNIFE COMMANDS:
See KNIFE_EXAMPLES.md for examples of commands

### knife.rb
To set 'client' as the default mode, add the following line to the knife.rb file.

```knife[:vault_mode] = 'client'```

To set the default list of admins for creating and updating vaults, add the following line to the knife.rb file.

```knife[:vault_admins] = [ 'example-alice', 'example-bob', 'example-carol' ]```

(These values can be overridden on the command line by using -A)

NOTE: chef-vault 1.0 knife commands are not supported!  Please use chef-vault 2.0 commands.

## USAGE IN RECIPES

To use this gem in a recipe to decrypt data you must first install the gem via a chef_gem resource.  Once the gem is installed require the gem and then you can create a new instance of ChefVault.

NOTE: chef-vault 1.0 style decryption is supported, however it has been deprecated and chef-vault 2.0 decryption should be used instead

### Example Code

```ruby
chef_gem "chef-vault"

require 'chef-vault'

item = ChefVault::Item.load("passwords", "root")
item["password"]
```

## USAGE STAND ALONE

`chef-vault` can be used as a stand alone binary to decrypt values stored in Chef.  It requires that Chef is installed on the system and that you have a valid knife.rb.  This is useful if you want to mix `chef-vault` into non-Chef recipe code, for example some other script where you want to protect a password.

It does still require that the data bag has been encrypted for the user's or client's pem and pushed to the Chef server. It mixes Chef into the gem and uses it to go grab the data bag.

Do `chef-vault --help` for all available options

### Example usage (password)

    chef-vault -v passwords -i root -a password -k /etc/chef/knife.rb
